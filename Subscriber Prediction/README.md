# MachineHack Subscriber Prediction Hackathon
MachineHack hosted a Subscriber Prediction Talent Search Hackathon to address the challenges of banking telecallers when they call blindly to people in order to sell term deposit plans. The aim of this hackathon is to find the most accurate prediction of whether a person to be called will subscribe to the term deposit plan or not using any of the machine learning algorithms.
